# MRI & fMRI datasets

## OpenfMRI 
[OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org/): is a data sharing resource for task-based fMRI data. It aims to provide a resource for any fMRI researcher who wishes to share their data openly.
The OpenfMRI project is managed by the Poldrack Lab and Center for Reproducible Neuroscience at Stanford University, with computing resources provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center and Amazon.com . 

## Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS Brains)
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies ([OASIS](https://www.oasis-brains.org/)): is a project aimed at making neuroimaging data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community. By compiling and freely distributing neuroimaging data sets, they hope to facilitate future discoveries in basic and clinical neuroscience.

## Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ([ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/data-types/)): is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of AlzheimerÂ’s disease (AD).

## FastMRI Dataset
[fastMRI](https://fastmri.org/dataset/): is a collaborative research project between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and NYU Langone Health. The aim is to investigate the use of AI to make MRI scans up to 10 times faster.

## MRI data
[MRI data](http://mridata.org/): is an open platform for researchers to share magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) raw k-space datasets.
